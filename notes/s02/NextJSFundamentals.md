# NextJS Fundamentals

## What is Next.JS?

* A framework built on top of React that gives you the flexibility of building scalable apps by allowing you to render 
content on the server.  
* In React, you always render content on the server. With NextJS, you can choose to do that on the client, 
on the server, or a mix of both.
